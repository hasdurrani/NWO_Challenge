# NWO_Challenge
NWO Challenge: Semantic Search

## Repository contents
* Instructions: [nlp-data-science-challenge.pdf](#instructions)
* IPython notebook: [nwo_challenge.ipynb](#jupyter-notebook)
* Script: [nwo_challenge.py](#script)

## Instructions
The PDF (nlp-data-science-challenge.pdf) contains the instructions for the challenge.
	
## IPython notebook
The  IPython Notebook (nwo_challenge.ipynb) provides a function by function breakdown for the code. 
	
## Script
The  python script file (nwo_challenge.py) contians the code which takes a query term as a system argument, and prints to console a ranked and ordered set of the top 5 closely associated trends.

## What's missing
I have purposely left out the JSON key needed to make the connection to the database. The JSON key (nwo-sample-5f8915fdc5ec.json)needs to be present in the same folder as the script in order to make queries against the database.
